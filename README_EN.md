## Manually Downloading and Importing Models

Due to the large size of model files, downloading them through the software may be challenging. You can manually download models and import them into the application. Here are two links for downloading models:

1. Domestic mirror (faster download speeds):
   https://hf-mirror.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main

2. Hugging Face official source:
   https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main

After downloading, you can import the model files into the application using the "Import Model" feature on the "Model Management" page.

Import steps:
1. On the "Model Management" page, click the "Import Model" button.
2. In the file selector that appears, choose your downloaded model file.
3. After confirming the import, the model will be added to your list of installed models.

## Common Issues

##### 1. "The application is damaged and can't be opened" message
Execute the following command in the terminal:

```shell
sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Video\ Subtitle\ Master.app
```
Then try running the application again.
